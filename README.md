# React Tankstack Table + Next JS 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

This project is designed to showcase JSON data retrieved from an endpoint in a tabular format. Utilizing the Tankstack React Table, a widely adopted tool for creating highly scalable and feature-rich tables, enhances the project's capabilities. Instead of opting for a custom table, leveraging Tankstack React Table provides scalability and an abundance of features.

Initially, I considered using Jotai for state management but eventually settled for normal state management. This decision was made to avoid unnecessary increases in bundle size that would come with additional packages. The table incorporates a filtering feature that allows users to filter data based on the name, implemented out of curiosity about its functionality. Additionally, each row is editable and deletable, achieved through the use of a modal with a blur overlay for added aesthetic appeal.
